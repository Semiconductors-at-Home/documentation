Germanium
==  
An element in group 14 of the periodic table with an electron configuration of `{1s: 2, 2s: 2, 2p: 6, 3s: 2, 3p: 6, 3d: 10, 4s: 2, 4p: 2}`. It tends to be more reactive than silicon.  

## Heat
Germanium semiconductors are more sensitive to heat than their silicon counterparts, and germanium has a melting point of 938.2c.

## Oxide layer

Germanium tends to grow thinner oxide layers than silicon and oxide thickness cannot be approximated by the naked eye. Germanium is translucent in the infrared spectrum and this was previously used by Philco to measure its thickness.

## Impurities  

Germanium tends to whisker.
