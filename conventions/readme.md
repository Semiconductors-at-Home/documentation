Principles
==
The creation of conventions for this documentation should obey the following principles:  
 - Be plaintext friendly  
  This is in order to maximise the ability to conserve meaning when copying between various mediums (chat, code, email etc), as well as making it easier  

 - Translation to more common notations should be easy  
  Not everyone uses our conventions, searching for information should not be hindered by these conventions.

## What is this directory for?
