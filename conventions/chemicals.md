Chemicals
==
Chemicals should be described either by name or in the format
`<coefficient if greater than 1><<element symbol><subscript>-...>`
One way reactions are represented with `->`, equilibriums are represented with `<->` and catalysts are represented by insertion into the arrow e.g: `-(Al2-O3)>` or `-(1400c)>`.

Example: `Si-O2 + 4H-F â†’ Si-F4 + 2H-2O`
