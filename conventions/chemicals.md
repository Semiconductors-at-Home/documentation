Chemicals
==
Chemicals should be described either by name or in the format
`<coefficient if greater than 1><<element symbol><subscript>...>`
One way reactions are represented with `->`, equilibriums are represented with `<->` and catalysts are represented by insertion into the arrow e.g: `-(Al2O3)>` or `-(1400c)>`.

Example: `SiO2 + 4HF -> SiF4 + 2H2O`
