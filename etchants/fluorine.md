Fluorine
==
Fluorine is used to etch silicon dioxide, this is most typically done with hydrofluoric acid in the reaction:
`SiO2 + 4HF -> SiF4 + 2H2O`

## Handling  
`HF` is most often stored in HDPE plastic containers. Recent research shows that polypropylene (PP) 3D printer filament loses only 0.9% of its mass in a typical HF dip[0]. Glassware containers will burst because glass is a form of `SiO2`.

## Disposal  
Do not dump HF down the drain, instead react completely with calcium carbonate to neutralise it first:
`CaCO3 + 2HF -> CaF2 + H2O`

## Legal  
In order to use `HF` in the UK you must obtain an [EPP licence](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supplying-explosives-precursors/supplying-explosives-precursors-and-poison).

## Safety
Because fluorine is extremely dangerous `HF` is preferred over the gas form since liquids are easier to handle, `HF` is hypertoxic and corrosive, if mishandled it will easily kill you. `HF` has a boiling point of 19.5c and so will fume above this temperature, these fumes contain `F2` and under no circumstances should be inhaled, it is advisable to use a fume hood or at the very least a respirator. `NaF2` is an ever so slightly safer alternative that reacts a little slower than regular HF. You should avoid using solutions above 5%.  

You should always have calcium gluconate on hand to apply immediately if skin is exposed to it. `HF` burns will not be immediately painful, you must carry out emergency procedure regardless. In order to avoid contact with skin PVC gloves should be worn.

If exposed it's advisable to consume TUMS Antacid [1], large amounts of milk or other food/drink that is high in calcium as this may help neutralise the fluorine[2].  

After administering first aid go to the hospital to make sure everything is clear.
