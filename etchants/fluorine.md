Fluorine
==
Fluorine is used to etch silicon dioxide, this is most typically done with hydrofluoric acid in the reaction:
`SiO2 + 4HF â†’ SiF4 + 2H2O`

## Handling  
`HF` can be stored in HDPE plastic containers. Glassware containers will burst because glass is a form of `SiO2`.

## Legal  
In order to use `HF` in the UK you must obtain an [EPP licence](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/supplying-explosives-precursors/supplying-explosives-precursors-and-poison).

## Safety
Because fluorine is extremely dangerous `HF` is preferred over the gas form since liquids are easier to handle, `HF` is a fuming, hypertoxic and corrosive, if mishandled it will easily kill you. `NaF2` is an ever so slightly safer alternative that reacts a little slower than regular HF. You should avoid using solutions above 5%. You should always have calcium gluconate on hand to apply immediately if skin is exposed to it. `H-F` burns will not be immediately painful, you must carry out emergency procedure regardless.

If exposed it's advisable to consume large amounts of milk or other drink/food that is high in calcium as this may help neutralise the flourine to form `Ca-F2`[0].
