Chlorine
==  
`Cl2` is a yellowish-green gas that can be used to etch `SiO2` with `N2` as a carrier gas at a temperature of 525c-575c with an etch rate of 1-10 nm/min however it does also remove phosphorous[0].  

## Handling
Alloy 22 (aka Hastelloy C22) can be used to contain `Cl2`.

## Safety
`Cl2` is flammable, highly corrosive and forms `HCl` on contact with moisture, it should be used in low concentrations in a fumehood or outside and away from other people. In case of a leak spraying the vapor with a water fire extinguisher may be useful as this will force it to form `HCl` and fall to the ground, decreasing the risk of breathing it in.
